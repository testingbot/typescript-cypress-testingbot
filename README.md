## Introduction

Cypress is a next generation front end testing tool built for the modern web. This example demonstrates how to run Cypress tests, written in Typescript, on [TestingBot](https://testingbot.com)
TestingBot is a cloud-based grid of browsers, ready to run your Cypress tests.

Simply specify the browsers you want to run the tests on. TestingBot will run the tests and generate a video, logs and screenshots of each Cypress test.
